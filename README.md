- Python
- PyTorch

## Dataset
- Primary: QANTA dataset (quiz bowl questions).
- Additional: Datasets to enhance model performance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Implement efficient data reading and preprocessing techniques.
2. **Model Training**: Fine-tune a transformer-based model on the classification task.
3. **Performance Analysis**: Analyze the model's accuracy as a function of the training data amount.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Handling Diverse Data**: Implement strategies to handle diverse question types and formats.
- **Optimization**: Techniques used to optimize the model for better performance.
